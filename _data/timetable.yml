      - title: An Event Driven Framework for Smart Contract Execution
        authors: Mudabbir Kaleem, Keshav Kasichainula, Rabimba Karanjai, Lei Xu, Zhimin Gao, Lin Chen and Weidong Shi
        abstract: "Blockchain-based smart contract platforms have traditionally em- ployed the transaction-driven execution model. This paper presents an alternate framework for blockchain-based smart contract execu- tion called EDSC. Our platform design presents a novel approach to tackle the scalability and performance challenges facing the smart contract ecosystem. We base EDSC’s design on the Ethereum tem- plate, and it can be readily implemented for other existing smart contract platforms. To evaluate our design, we perform an experi- mental implementation using the Ethereum client. Our experiments with performance modeling show, on average, a 2.2 to 4.6 times reduced total latency of event-triggered smart contracts, demon- strating the effectiveness of the design in supporting time-sensitive applications. Additionally, we comment on the design’s potential security aspects and demonstrate its utility by discussing potential use cases."

      - title: An Experimental Framework for Improving the Performance of BFT Consensus For Future Permissioned Blockchains
        authors: Man-Kit Sit, Manuel Bravo and Zsolt István
        abstract: "Permissioned Blockchains are increasingly considered in enter- prise use-cases, many of which do not require geo-distribution, or even disallow it due to legislation. Examples include country- wide networks, such as Alastria, or those deployed using cloud- based platforms such as IBM Blockchain Platform. We expect these blockchains to eventually run in environments with high band- width and low latency modern networks, as well as with advanced programmable hardware accelerators.<br/>Even though there is renewed interest in BFT consensus algo- rithms with various proposals targeting Permissioned Blockchains, related work does not optimize for fast networks and does not incorporate hardware accelerators – we make the case that doing so will pay off in the long run. To this end, we re-implemented the seminal PBFT algorithm in a way that allows us to measure different configurations of the protocol. Through this we explore the benefits of various common optimization strategies and show that the protocol is unlikely to saturate more than 10Gbps networks without relying on specialized hardware-based offloading.<br/>Based on the experimental results, we discuss two concrete ways in which the cost of consensus in Permissioned Blockchains could be reduced in high-speed networking environments, namely, of- floading to SmartNICs and implementing the protocol on standalone FPGAs."

      - title: Box Queries over Multi-Dimensional Streams
        authors: Roy Friedman and Rana Shahout
        abstract: "Answering statistical queries about streams of online arriving data is becoming increasingly important. Often, such data includes multiple-attributes, so data elements can be viewed as points in a multi-dimensional universe. This paper extends existing works on streaming algorithms by studying the ability to perform box queries on online multi-dimensional data streams. We develop three algo- rithms C-DARQ, DARQ and MARQ that support such capabilities for a large number of statistical functions including (but not limited to) counting, frequency estimation, heavy-hitters etc. The protocols are analyzed and evaluated over synthetic and datasets from Kaggle in multiple dimensions (up to 8). Our algorithms asymptotically improve the space bounds as well as update and query performance of existing works. Unlike known approaches, our algorithms can also be used to solve a larger class of problems beyond counting. We further discuss extending our work to the sliding window model and when the dimensions’ bounds are a-priori unknown."
      - title: Fast Recovery of Correlated Failures in Distributed Stream Processing Engines
        authors: Li Su and Yongluan Zhou
        abstract: "In a large-scale cluster, correlated failures usually involve a number of nodes failing simultaneously. Although correlated failures occur infrequently, they have significant effect on systems’ availability, es- pecially for streaming applications that require real-time analysis, as repairing the failed nodes or acquiring additional ones would take a significant amount of time. Most state-of-the-art distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs) focus on recovering individual failures and do not consider the optimization for recovering correlated failure. In this work, we propose an incremental and query-centric recovery paradigm where the recovery of failed operator partitions would be carefully scheduled based on the current availability of resources, such that the outputs of queries can be recovered as early as possible. By analyzing the existing recovery techniques, we identify the challenges and propose a fault-tolerance framework that can support incremen- tal recovery with minimum overhead during the system’s normal execution. We also formulate the new problem of recovery schedul- ing under correlated failures and design algorithms to optimize the recovery latency with a performance guarantee. A comprehensive set of experiments are conducted to study the validity of our proposal."

      - title: Distributed Transactions on Serverless Stateful Functions
        authors: Martijn de Heus, Kyriakos Psarakis, Marios Fragkoulis and Asterios Katsifodimos
        abstract: "Serverless computing is currently the fastest-growing cloud services segment. The most prominent serverless offering is Function-as-a- Service (FaaS), where users write functions and the cloud automates deployment, maintenance, and scalability. Although FaaS is a good fit for executing stateless functions, it does not adequately sup- port stateful constructs like microservices and scalable, low-latency cloud applications, mainly because it lacks proper state manage- ment support and the ability to perform function-to-function calls. Most importantly, executing transactions across stateful functions remains an open problem.<br/>In this paper, we introduce a programming model and implemen- tation for transaction orchestration of stateful serverless functions. Our programming model supports serializable distributed trans- actions with two-phase commit, as well as relaxed transactional guarantees with Sagas. We design and implement our programming model on Apache Flink StateFun. We choose to build our solution on top of StateFun in order to leverage Flink’s exactly-once processing and state management guarantees. We base our evaluation on the YCSB benchmark, which we extended with transactional operations and adapted for the SFaaS programming model. Our experiments show that our transactional orchestration adds 10% overhead to the original system and that Sagas can achieve up to 34% more transactions per second than two-phase commit transactions at a sub-200ms latency."
      - title: A Distributed Database System for Event-based Microservices
        authors: <a target="_blank" href="http://rnlaigner.github.io/">Rodrigo Laigner</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://ylzhou.github.io/">Yongluan Zhou</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~vmarcos/">Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles</a>
        abstract: "Microservice architectures are an emerging industrial approach to build large scale and event-based systems. In this architectural style, an application is functionally partitioned into several small and au- tonomous building blocks, so-called microservices, communicating and exchanging data with each other via events.<br/>By pursuing a model where fault isolation is enforced at mi- croservice level, each microservice manages their own database, thus database systems are not shared across microservices. Developers end up encoding substantial data management logic in the application-tier and encountering a series of challenges on enforcing data integrity and maintaining data consistency across microservices.<br/>In this vision paper, we argue that there is a need to rethink how database systems can better support microservices and relieve the burden of handling complex data management tasks faced by programmers. We envision the design and research opportunities for a novel distributed database management system targeted at event-driven microservices."
